# Sentinel-Monitor
Sentinel Monitor is a Python-based intelligent security system designed to prevent unauthorized access to a computer system. It uses face recognition, secure authentication, and real-time monitoring to detect unauthorized users and immediately protect the screen using a locking/overlay mechanism.

The system is suitable for:

- Personal computers
- Shared systems in offices or labs
- Examination environments
- Sensitive workstations

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🚫 Prevent unauthorized access using face recognition.
- 🖥️ Provide a secure admin-controlled interface.
- 🕵️ Detect intrusions in real time.
- 🛡️ Protect system visibility using screen overlay.
- 🔒 Secure sensitive data using encryption.
