# Sentinel-Monitor
Sentinel Monitor is a Python-based intelligent security system designed to prevent unauthorized access to a computer system. It uses face recognition, secure authentication, and real-time monitoring to detect unauthorized users and immediately protect the screen using a locking/overlay mechanism.

The system is suitable for:

💠 Personal computers
💠 Shared systems in offices or labs
💠 Examination environments
💠 Sensitive workstations

🎯 Objectives

🚫 Prevent unauthorized access using face recognition.
🖥️ Provide a secure admin-controlled interface.
🕵️ Detect intrusions in real time.
🛡️ Protect system visibility using screen overlay.
🔒 Secure sensitive data using encryption.
